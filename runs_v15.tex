Here we look at various experiments that explore varying a single aspect of the scheduler. 


%############ Dust With Alternating ############
\subsubsection{Dust With Alternating}

XXX--add the alt dust plots
\begin{figure}
\caption{}\label{fig:altdust}
\end{figure}
This uses the dusty footprint, and uses a basis function to encourage the scheduler to alternate between the north and south nightly. This was originally done in the altSched \citep{Rothchild19}. This can help keep light curve sampling optimally spaced. By using a basis function, we encourage alternating north/south, but it is not absolutely enforced, making it possible for the scheduler to avoid the moon.

There is no additional NES, however there is a strip in the north observed in $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$.

%############ Bulge ############
\subsection{Bulge}

We used recommendations from the SAC for different strategies for observing the galactic bulge. These simulations use the Big Sky footprint similar to the Olsen et al white paper.  

We use three footprints for bulge coverage 1) light coverage of the bulge and entire galactic plane, 2) the bulge as deep as WFD and 3) the bulge covered similarly to WFD, but with more observations in $i$.  For each of these strategies, we run a version with natural cadence and one where we boost the priority of the bulge if it has not been observed in 2.5 days.

\epsscale{1}
\caption{Intentionally taking observations at higher airmass to measure DCR.}
\end{figure}


The LSST will not have an atmospheric chromatic corrector, thus difference imaging can be complicated by differential chromatic refraction (DCR). There is also potential science opportunities by being able to measure the chromatic shift in objects with sharp features in their SEDs.

These experiments look at how we could intentionally schedule a subset of images to be at high airmass so a DCR model could be built up. We test various combinations of filters to demand DCR observations (u+g, u+g+r, and u+g+r+i), and the number of observations to take at high airmass per year (1 or 2). 

Note, even with 2 high airmass observations per year, we would still expect some area of the sky to fall in chip and raft gaps.  It is also worth noting that in our baseline simulation, we observe a spot on the sky in u typically 60 times, or 6 times per year. Taking 2 high airmass observations per year in u decreases the final coadded depth by 0.15 mags.

%############ Deep Drilling Fields ############
\subsection{Deep Drilling Fields}

We have run a variety of DDF strategies. Figure~\ref{fig:ddfexamples} shows the same observing season of the DDF ELIASS1 with 5 different strategies. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item{AGN: This strategy takes shorter DDF sequences more often. Only $\sim$2.5\% of visits are spent on DDFs, making the final coadded depths much shallower than other strategies.}
    \item{DESC: a strategy that split the blue and red filters to different days, emphasizing a 3-day cadence}
    \item{Baseline:  Our baseline strategy where 5\% of observations are allocated to DDF observations.}
    \item{Daily: Similar to the baseline, but includes short DDF sequences that can execute daily so there are no long gaps between observations}
    \item{DDF Heavy:  Similar to the baseline, but XXX\% of visits are allocated to DDF observations}
\end{itemize}

XXX--science discussion.  Point out we desperately need more DDF-specific metrics from the community. 


%############ Filter Distribution ############
\subsection{Filter Distribution}

Testing a simple WFD-only footprint, but varying the requested ratio of observations in different filters. The different filter distributions simulated are listed in Table~\ref{table:filtdist}.  

\begin{table}
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrr}
              Name &     $u$ &     $g$ &  $r$ &     $i$ &     $z$ &     $y$ \\

\epsscale{1}
\caption{The different survey footprints simulated.}
\end{figure}

We test a wide variation of possible survey footprints. Some of these are more realistic than others. 


%############ Good Seeing ############

\subsection{Good Seeing}\label{ss:goodseeing}

These test the ability to ensure the entire WFD area is imaged in ``good seeing" conditions every year, here defined as FWHM of 0.7 arcseconds or better.  

These runs work well and it seems to add no particular overhead to the observing. It might make it more challenging to implement in operations, simply because the baseline simulation can simulate an entire night and pass off the list to be observed. If we want to run with the goal of collecting good seeing images, we will need to update the observing queue every time the seeing conditions change significantly, which could result in changing the upcomming observations more often than is desired.

%############ Short Exposures ############
\subsection{Short Exposures}

\begin{figure}
\plottwo{plots/short_exp_plots/opsim_Count_filter_visitexposuretime_gt_10_and_note_not_like_DD_HEAL_SkyMap.pdf}{plots/short_exp_plots/opsim_Count_filter_visitexposuretime_lt_10_HEAL_SkyMap.pdf}
\caption{Results from including 5s exposures (up to 5 per year). The left shows the number of regular 30s visits (excluding DDF observations) and the right shows the number of 5s visits.}
\end{figure}

We try taking additional short exposures (1s or 5s) twice or five times per year. Taking shorter exposures is a less efficient observing mode, but it seems to have little impact on the overall open shutter fraction.

%############ Spiders ############
\subsection{Spiders}

We look at keeping diffraction spikes aligned along CCD rows and columns. This may result in the camera rotator angle being much less randomized than our baseline rotational dithering strategy.

xxx--Science recap: Should be almost identical to baseline. 

%############ Third Observation ############
\subsection{Third Observation}

For early identification of transients, it can be helpful to have more than two observations in a night. In these observations, we dedicate between 15 and 120 minutes at the end of the night to attempting to observe areas of sky that already have been observed.

%############ Twilight NEO Survey ############
\subsection{Twilight NEO Survey}

This is an implementation of white paper XXX, where we use twilight time to take short exposures along the ecliptic to search for NEOs. 

If we dedicate all twilight time to NEO searches, we fail to meet the SRD requirements. Thus we also check running the NEO survey every 2, 3, or 4 days.

%############ Longer u ############
\subsection{Longer $u$\ Exposure Time}\label{ss:u60}

The u-band observations are often expected be readnoise limited. We test doubling the u-band exposure time and cutting the number of exposures in half. This results in the u-band final coadded depth reaching $\sim$0.20 mags deeper. The g-band is also 0.10 mags deeper, with the rest of the filters essentially unchanged in final depth.

Note, we assume that 1x60s visit counts as 2 30s visits for the purpose of meeting the SRD value of 825 visits in the WFD area. Adopting longer exposures in u seems like a good idea, but the SRD will probably need to be modified to ensure it is not ambiguous.

%############ Variable Exposure Times ############
\subsection{Variable Exposure Times}

\begin{figure}
\plottwo{plots/variable_expt_plots/baseline_spot.pdf}{plots/variable_expt_plots/varexpt_spot.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of a sample WFD point in the baseline and when we vary the exposure time. The individual observations depths become more uniform, especially in the redder filters that can be observed in bright time and twilight.}\label{fig:varexptime}
\end{figure}

We vary the exposure time based on the current conditions so individual exposures have similar depths. There is an argument that taking a full 30s visit in ideal dark time conditions results in ``wasted depth", as more objects and transients will be detected, but then it will be impossible to identify them as later visits are unlikely to be as deep. Similarly, taking a 30s visit in poor conditions will result in a shallow image which will be of limited use. In good conditions, the expsoure time is allowed to shrink to 20s, and in poor conditions it can extend to 100s.

As with doing 60s u band exposures, this may require modifying the detailed specifics of the SRD as longer exposures may need to count as multiple visits.

Having variable exposure time introduces at least 8 new free parameters to the scheduler (the target individual depth for each filter), as well as the shortest and longest acceptable exposure times.  As with \ref{ss:goodseeing}, this would be more complicated to run in operations as the scheduler would need current conditions to calculate the modified exposure times, although the predicted sky brightness may be accurate enough.

%############ WFD Depth ############
\subsection{WFD Depth}

\epsscale{1}
\caption{Varying the amount of time dedicated to the WFD region between 65\% and 99\% of the visits.}
\end{figure}


We vary what fraction of the observing time is dedicated to the WFD area, from 60\% to 99\% with and without the standard DDF surveys. Unsurprisingly, the SRD is not met if the WFD is only given 60\%.

\end{figure}



%############ Even Filters ############
\subsection{Even Filters}

The baseline simulation is fairly aggressive in switching to redder filters in bright time. This can create long gaps in light curves with no bluer observations. We have run a simulation where only the $u$, and $g$\ filters avoid bright time, and a simulation where only $u$\ avoids bright time. Figure~\ref{fig:even_filt_hourglass} shows the resulting filter distributions in year one. Unlike the baseline simulations, there are no longer sections of several days where only $y$\ is observed.


\begin{figure}
\label{fig:even_filt_hourglass}

\caption{The filter distribution for the even filter simulations. Unlike the baseline simulations, bluer filters are observed in bright time.}
\end{figure}

XXX--science recap. Should be less depth, but maybe better long transient light curves.

%############ Aliasing ############
\subsection{Aliasing}

There was concern that if observations were too uniformly placed on the meridian, periodic sources would be aliased. Figure~\ref{fig:alias} shows the FFT of observations at a sample WFD point in the baseline simulation. There is some aliasing at $\sim1$\ day which is inevitable for any ground-based telescope.  The aliasing is much lower than the minion\_1016 simulation that was analyzed in the Bell et al. cadence white paper.

\caption{Aliasing at a sample position in a baseline simulation. There are peaks at harmonics of 24 hours, but this is inevitable with a ground-based telescope. The aliasing seems much lower than earlier version of OpSim where harmonic peaks could be seen past 200 $\mu$Hz.}
