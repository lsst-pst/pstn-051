\section{Summary}

We investigated a wide variety of survey strategy options in this report. 



The work of coming to a consensus on the survey strategy is beginning. The investigations presented in this report will help address:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choices about the visit exposure time (snaps, variable exposure time and $u$ band visits): Section~\ref{sec:visitexposuretime}.
\item Choices about the intra-night cadence (pairs and triplets): Section~\ref{sec:intranight}.
\item Rolling cadence questions (None, 2, 3 or 6 band declination stripes): Section~\ref{ss:rolling}.
\item Deep Drilling Field cadences: Section~\ref{ss:ddf}.
\item Minisurvey options: Section~\ref{sec:minisurveys}, as well as Sections~\ref{ss:twilightneo}. \ref{ss:shortexp} and \ref{ss:dcr}.
\item Choices about the filter distribution: Section~\ref{ss:filterdist}.
\item And the hard choices about the survey footprint (WFD, NES, SCP, GP): Section~\ref{sec:bigfootprints}.
\end{itemize}
Some additional metrics are needed, especially for investigating photometric redshift performance, DCR measurement capabilities, and science return from short images. Metrics to test DDF cadences and to clarify observation requirements for transient classification are also critical. Some questions not addressed here, but that should be considered in the future include dithering strategies, acquiring images for difference image template generation, and the impact of satellite megaconstellations.
