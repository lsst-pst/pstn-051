\section{Summary}

The work of coming to a consensus on the survey strategy is beginning. The simulations presented in this report cover many of the major survey strategy questions. The hardest questions include choices about the survey footprint and how much time to allocate to remaining minisurveys (and how to allocate that time among those minisurveys). Clearly additional metrics will be useful: metrics which push into transient classification, photometric redshift performance (as input to the filter distribution) and DDF metrics are all high priorities. Some questions not addressed here, but that should be considered in the future include dithering strategies, acquiring images for difference image template generation, and the impact of satellite megaconstellations.
